# Script for Extracting Frames from a Video

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library (cv2) to extract frames from a video file and save them as individual image files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x and OpenCV installed on your system.
2. Save your video file as "video.mp4" in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the `extract_frames.py` script.

The script will read the "video.mp4" file and save each frame as a JPEG image file in the "images" folder. The image files will be sequentially named (e.g., "1.jpg", "2.jpg", etc.).

## Example Usage

```bash
python extract_frames.py
```

This README provides a brief description of the script, the requirements needed to run it, instructions on how to use it, and an example of usage. Remember, documentation in the README should be clear and concise so that users can quickly understand how to utilize the code.
